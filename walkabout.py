## @package walkabout
# Walking navigation and wall collision class
# Contains only static members and member functions so you do not need to create any objects of this class to use it.
# To import the module into your own program:
#
#	from walkabout import walkabout
#
# To initialize call:
#
#	walkabout.init(getDefaultCamera())
#
# Then use it in your onUpdate function as follows:
#
#	walkabout.update(dt) -- where dt is the dt given to you by Omegalib on each frame update.
#
# A number of accessor functions can be used to change the behavior of the code. See documentation for details.

## walkabout class
# This class is used to enable walking over geometry in Omegalib. Collision detection is also provided
# so that you can't walk through walls or over high tables or fences, for example.
# It works by firing a ray downward in the scene to determine how high to raise you, and it also
# fires a second ray forward and downward to look for barriers in the direction you are walking.
